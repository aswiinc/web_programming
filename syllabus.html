<p><i>A client-server network is the medium through which clients access resources and services from a central computer, via either a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet. The three-tier client-server architecture consists of a presentation tier known as the User Interface layer, an application tier called the Service layer, and a data tier comprising the database server.

<h3 id="components" style="color:E1FFB1;font-size:25px;"><u>Components  of  Web  Application</u></h3><br>
<img src="PngItem_1272123.png" height="250" width="250" align="left">
<p><i>All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.Any web application includes two parts - server (back-end) and client (front-end). Clients interact with the front-end part directly, evaluating the interface and its convenience, and the client code reacts to all user actions.There are two main types of components: visible and non-visible. Visible components such as Button, TextBox, Label, etc. are part of the User Interface.

<h3 id="content" style="color:E1FFB1;font-size:25px;"><u>Types  of Web Content</u></h3><br>
<img src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/4/Website-PNG-File-Download-Free.png" height="250" width="250" align="left">
<p><i>There are 3 types of online content: content that 'persuades', content that 'sells' and content that 'reassures'.Web content refers to the textual, aural, or visual content published on a website. Content means any creative element, for example, text, applications, images, archived e-mail messages, data, e-services, audio and video files, and so on.Web content may include webpage document pages, information, software data and applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages

<p><i>HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection.The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.

<h3 id="dynamic" style="color:E1FFB1;font-size:25px;"><u>Generation of dynamic web pages</u></h3><br>

<p><i>Web pages that use server-side scripting are often created with the help of server-side languages such as PHP, Perl, ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, ColdFusion and other languages. These server-side languages typically use the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to produce dynamic web pages.A dynamic page displays different content for different users while retaining the same layout and design. Such pages, usually written in CGI, AJAX, ASP or ASP.NET, take more time to load than simple static pages. They’re frequently implemented to show information that changes frequently, e.g., weather updates or stock prices.

Dynamic pages usually contain application programs for different services and require server-side resources like databases. A database allows the page creator to separate the website’s design from the content to be displayed to users. Once they upload content into the database, it is retrieved by the website in response to a user request.

<h3 id="Servers" style="color:E1FFB1;font-size:25px;"><u> Application Servers</u></h3><br>
<img src="pngegg.png" height="250" width="250" align="left">
<p><i>An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.Application Servers example are JBoss , Glassfish.Application server contains Web and EJB containers. It can be used for servlet, jsp, struts, jsf, ejb etc. It is a component based product that lies in the middle-tier of a server centric architecture. It provides the middleware services for state maintenance and security, along with persistence and data access.An application server typically can deliver web content too, but its primary job is to enable interaction between end-user clients and server-side application code—the code representing what is often called business logic—to generate and deliver dynamic content, such as transaction results, decision support, or real
